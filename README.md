# tyr

Tyr is a dynamic distributed computing compiler/runtime that uses LLVM to automatically lift
your code from one machine to a distributed deployment.

## Design

tyr consists of two pieces, a compiler and a runtime.

### Compiler
tyr's compiler operates on LLVM modules. It finds the routing code and the application code
and splits them into separate modules - the output is a set of routing rules and executables that
actually execute the business logic.

### Runtime
tyr's runtime consists of a Router, a Processor, and a Sink.
- Router: Routes incoming requests based on routing rules determined by the compiler
- Processor: Executes business logic from executables generated by the compiler
- Sink: Collects request results and returns them to the client (if applicable)

### Requirements
```
protobuf >= 3.5 (brew install protobuf)
llvm == 6.0.0 (brew install llvm --with-toolchain) <- also installs clang-format
```
NOTE: if we can get rid of protobuf we can also remove the requirement that we use
RTTI which means we can use the LLVM style RTTI and remove vtables entirely.

### Building
```
cd /path/to/tyr
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
