## Rust Bindings

The rust bindings are generated using the [rust bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) project.

You will need to create a `build.rs` file in order to use `cargo build`. An example is provided 
in `test/rust/build.rs`.

If you installed `tyr` to a non-system directory, you will need to edit the autogenerated
build file, which will be named `build_<modulename>_bindings.rs`. Add the following
line: `.clang_arg("-I/path/to/tyr/install")` anywhere above the `.generate()` call,
so that `bindgen` can find the runtime include path.

Here is an example of what it should look like after the modifications. In this
example, `tyr` has been installed to `tyr/test/install`. This was generated 
from the `path.tyr` file that's checked into `tyr/test`

```rust
extern crate bindgen;

use std::env;
use std::path::PathBuf;

pub fn build_bindings() {
    let bindings = bindgen::Builder::default()
        .header("/path/to/tyr/test/./rust/path.h")
        .clang_arg("/path/to/tyr/test/./rust/path.o")
        // Manually added
        .clang_arg("-I/path/to/tyr/test/install/include")
        .generate()
        .expect("Unable to generate bindings");

    let out_path = PathBuf::from(env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap());
    bindings
        .write_to_file(out_path.join("path_bindings.rs"))
        .expect("Couldn't write bindings!");
}
```
